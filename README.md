## Development Boilerplate

This project includes a barebones development scaffold consisting of:

1. Yarn package manager
2. Vite dev tooling configured for vanilla TypeScript
3. Phaser with Vite and TypeScript configured to account for the lack of top-level default export
4. A basic app consisting of an empty Phaser scene

### Setup Instructions

1. Install Yarn package manager if you haven't already: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
2. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
4. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
5. Start the development server: `yarn dev`
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action
